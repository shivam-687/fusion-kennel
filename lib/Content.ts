We are from Malabar and Red Kennels connected us with the puppy (42 days old) and her parents from Kottayam promptly. We had video sessions to pick from the litter and another video was sent just before she was transported to us. The journey was well planned and we were called often with updates. While we were initially worried about getting a puppy transported across the length of Kerala, Red Kennels and the puppy parents, and the transport team did a stellar job of making sure she reached us safe and happy. We heartily recommend all of their services.',
